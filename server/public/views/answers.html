<form class="eightBall" ng-submit="getAnswer()">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Got a question?" ng-model="question">
    <input type="submit" value="Ask!">
</form>
This form doesn't actually do anything except show a random response when you click the button. Doesn't work in IE and I don't know why.
<div>
    {{answer}}
</div>
